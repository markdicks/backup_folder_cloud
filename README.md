This Python code provides an example of how to use the Google Drive API to authenticate and obtain credentials for accessing Google Drive data. It uses the Google OAuth2 library to authenticate the user and obtain a token to access their Google Drive data. If the credentials are not valid or do not exist, the script will initiate a user authorization flow to obtain a new token. Once the token is obtained, it is saved to a file for later use. The script then uses the token to authenticate and authorize the user to access their Google Drive data through the Google Drive API. This code can be used as a starting point for building Python applications that interact with the Google Drive API.
