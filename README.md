# backup_folder_cloud
This is a Python script that backs up a local directory to Google Drive using the PyDrive library. Here's a breakdown of how the script works:
The script imports the necessary libraries, PyDrive and os.
The script authenticates with the Google Drive API using the GoogleAuth object from PyDrive. The user is prompted to authorize the script with their Google account.
The authenticated GoogleDrive object is obtained from the GoogleAuth object.
The user is prompted to enter the directory path to back up.
The script checks if a folder with the same name already exists in Google Drive. If it does, the folder ID is obtained.
If the folder does not exist, a new folder is created with the specified name using the GoogleDrive object.
The directory to be backed up is uploaded to Google Drive as a new folder with the specified name using the GoogleDrive object.
The script iterates through the files in the local directory using the os.walk() method.
For each file, the script checks if a file with the same name already exists in Google Drive. If it does, the existing file is updated with the local file's contents using the SetContentFile() method.
If the file does not exist in Google Drive, a new file is created with the specified name using the GoogleDrive object and the contents of the local file are uploaded to the new file.
Overall, this script can be used to back up a local directory to Google Drive and keep the contents of the backup up-to-date with any changes made to the local directory.
